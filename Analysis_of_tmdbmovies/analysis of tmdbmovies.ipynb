Before submitting your project, it will be a good idea to go back through your report and remove these sections to make the presentation of your work as tidy as possible. First things first, you might want to double-click this Markdown cell and change the title so that it reflects your dataset and investigation.\n",

    "> **Tip**: In this section of the report, provide a brief introduction to the dataset you've selected for analysis. At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",

One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations in an initial notebook. These don't have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, create a duplicate notebook where you will trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report.\n",

It also confirms that producers will use movie genres to set budgets for any movie.When looking at mean values by genre it appears that mean budget values are significantly higher than the mean revenue values. This could be because most movies in a genre may have relatively close budgets, while the revenue values are low because large number of movies could have low to medium revenue and very few movies could have high revenues.\n",

These values when corrected could possibly add more data to the plot above. So there could  be movies that have budget values that are excluded due to errors in data.

This shows than anything below 100 and above 200 generally have low popularity ratings.

    "# We see that between 1960 to 1989, a science fiction movie in 1982 and adventure move in 1980 has the highest revenue. The movie genre varies from year to year this shows that there is no preference by people on the genre of the movie. The quality of the movie appears to be more significant that the genre. The few movies with higher revenues between 1973 to 1983 could be classified as classics. It appears that movies with the adventure genre have been the highest grossing movies 12 times in 30 years. While the action genre is suprisingly seen only 3 times. The second highest interms of appearances is drama which occurs 8 times in 30 years, this was not expected to be the case.\n",

Additionally, there is a thin line between action and adventure, it might be better suited to combine both action and adventure into one category, this is not done here. This dataset is also limited due to the exclusion of budget and revenue values of zero as we consider only the highest revenue rows. If a budget value of zero has one of the highest revenues, that is surely an error in the data. After correction of these we can possibly see a change in th above plot.

Additionally the data does not include revenue values and budget values that are zero, since these rows are excluded.

Budget or revenue values of zero are considered to be erros but after correcting the data it would help me us better understand budget vs revenue relationship.

    "1) a.On plotting the director, primary_Actor vs revenue bar graph, we find that the director, primary actor combination with highest revenue is David yates and Daniel radcliffe\n",
    "  b. We then study how budget varies with genres,Animation and adventure have the highest budget value. Depending on the genre, a movie budget can vary from relatively low to high.\n",
    "  c. Runtimes between 100 and 180 have higher count of budget values. Runtimes greater than 180 and less than 100 have smaller budget values. The budget values do not have a linear relationship with runtime. More than 80% of budget values from 1960 to 2015 are in that range so there is high probability that next years data will also contain a large amount of budget values in the same range.\n",
    "   d. Budget values have a postive correlation with year as expected. As we progress through the years, movie budgets have gotten higher.\n",
    "   e.The popularity values are concentrated between runtimes of 100 to 200 and 80% of the values are between 0 to 10. Popularity does not increase or decrease with runtime but is focussed within a range for all runtime values.\n",
    "   f. Budget does not have a relationship with popularity. Medium and high budget share popularity values with low budget movies. Popularity values of 0 to 10  captures close to 80% of the movies. This shows that budget and popularity are not correlated.\n",

    "2) The second question focuses on what genres are popular from year to year. The popular genres from 1960 to 2015 are adventure, action and drama. Adventure genre has the maximum number of occurences of 24, the drama genre is unexpectedly more popular than war or comedy. Adventure genre is also seen to be very successful between years of 1999 to 2007."

    "3) a.We find contradictory to general assumptions, the most popular movie is not the highest grossing movie.Infact movies with popularity rating between 4 to 9 have a higher revenues that those between 12 to 28. The revenues and popularity do not appear to be related to each other at all The  The budgets are fairly consistent and are relatively small when compared with revenue. All the movies shown the graph are profitable inspite of their popularity values.\n",
    "   b.Runtime values between 121 to 194 show greater in revenue than others. We see a few higher values towards the end of the plot but it is possible to accurately determine their correlation. I believe that a within a certain runtime range there is a greater percentage of high revenue values. This can determined only by further analysis\n",
    "   c.Interms of vote_average. We see that the values between 7.1 and 7.3 have the highest vote_average values. The general assumption is that higher vote_average will have higher_revenue but this is proven wrong. Thus we can conclude higher vote_average will not neccesarily mean higher revenue.\n",
    "   d.Budget and revenue show some positive relationship for budget values higher than 170000000 show higher revenue values than the lower budget values. Considering that the highest revenue values are taken in this dataset, another sample must examined to clearly understand the relationship. But i can conclude that the budget value does not determine revenue, lower budgets can result in higher revenues and vice-versa.\n",
    "   e. Another interesting thing of note is 4 movies have popularities between 12 and 22, 3 movies have popularities between 23 and 33. The remaining movies have popularities between 0 and 11. The revenues of movies with popularity between 12 and 33 are not significant.This shows that popularity and revenue do not have a positive correlation."
